cluster.name: mycluster

# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for the node:
#
node.name: bab1
#node.name: bab2   for 2nd node
#node.name: bab3   for 3rd node
#
# Add custom attributes to the node:
#
node.roles: [master,data]
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
#
# By default Elasticsearch is only accessible on localhost. Set a different
# address here to expose this node on the network:
#
network.host: 37.32.12.116
#network.host: 37.32.13.243     for 2nd node
#network.host: 37.32.15.140     for 3rd node
#
# By default Elasticsearch listens for HTTP traffic on the first free port it
# finds starting at 9200. Set a specific HTTP port here:
#
http.port: 9200
# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
#
# Pass an initial list of hosts to perform discovery when this node is started:
# The default list of hosts is ["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]
#
discovery.seed_hosts: ["37.32.12.116:9300", "37.32.13.243:9300", "37.32.15.140:9300"]
#
# Bootstrap the cluster using an initial set of master-eligible nodes:
#
cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["37.32.12.116", "37.32.13.243", "37.32.15.140"]
